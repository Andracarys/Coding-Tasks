# Pillow

# Pillow is a Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that adds support for opening, manipulating,
# and saving many different image file formats.
# It is widely used for image processing tasks in Python.
# Official documentation: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
# Installation: pip install Pillow
# Basic usage:
# from PIL import Image
# image = Image.open("example.jpg")  # Open an image file
# image.show()  # Display the image
# image.save("example.png")  # Save the image in a different format
# image.resize((width, height))  # Resize the image
# image.rotate(angle)  # Rotate the image by a given angle
# image.crop((left, upper, right, lower))  # Crop the image to the specified box
# image.convert("L")  # Convert the image to grayscale
# image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)  # Apply a blur filter to the image
# image.format  # Get the format of the image (e.g., JPEG, PNG)
# image.size  # Get the size of the image (width, height)
# image.mode  # Get the color mode of the image (e.g., RGB, RGBA, L)
# More advanced features include drawing shapes, adding text, and working with image sequences (e.g., animated GIFs).
# Example of creating an animated GIF from multiple images:
# images = [Image.open("frame1.png"), Image.open("frame2.png")]
# images[0].save("animation.gif", save_all=True, append_images=images[1:], duration=200, loop=0)
